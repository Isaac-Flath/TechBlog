# This is My (Isaac Flath) Blog.

## About Me üëã

I'm a data scientist with a varied background that likes doing varied things.  It's also given me a wide range of skills that prove useful in all sorts of surprising ways.   

My most important ability is understanding strategic goals and being able to translate that into all the detailed steps needed to get there (and seeing what steps that are not needed).  I developed this skill by getting experience in very different roles in lots of different parts of the business.

My primary hobby is dance.  I used to teach ballroom dance, but now I mostly dance West Coast Swing as a hobby.
