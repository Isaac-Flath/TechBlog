## About Me üëã

I'm a data scientist with a varied background that likes doing varied things.  It's also given me a wide range of skills that prove useful in all sorts of surprising ways.   

My most important ability is understanding to goal and being able to see all the detailed steps needed to get there (and seeing the detailed steps that are not needed).  I developed this skill by getting experience in very different roles, where I often had to do things I did not have any idea how to do.  The best way to do that is to break the task into pieces that you can research separately.  

Often, nobody in the world has done exactly what you are doing.  But it's almost a certainty that whatever you want to do is a combination of things that are already out there.  If you see the pieces you can learn what you need as you go.

My primary hobby is dance.  I used to teach ballroom dance, but now I mostly dance West Coast Swing as a hobby.
