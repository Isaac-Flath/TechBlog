    "Isaac is a rock star. Having had the privilege of working with him in a day-to-day capacity for several years, I can say that he is among the best and brightest individuals I have ever worked with. His analytics and data sciences chops are top notch, but his ability to combine technical expertise with a deep understanding of people and process to prescribe - and build - the optimal full stack solution is where he stands heads and shoulders above the rest of the pack. His work for Centriam's clients has moved the needle time and again to drive real world business results!\n",
