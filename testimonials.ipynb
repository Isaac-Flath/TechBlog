    "I have had the distinct pleasure of working directly with Isaac Flath as well as observing Isaac‚Äôs performance in working with others on team projects as well as individual assignments. What makes Isaac exceptional is his genuine interest and curiosity in understanding the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each project. This voluntary effort enables Isaac to bring innovative ideas and approaches to each initiative that routinely enable outcomes to be better than originally imagined. Isaac is also a joy to work with which is critically important for those working in remote or hybrid environments.  \n",

He is able to walk me through things I don‚Äôt understand and explain them in effective way, while also showing me the path to go above and beyond.  Often these new directions are ones I never would have discovered myself.  This has been true while working under him in a professional setting as well as when discussing ideas and techniques while working alongside him on personal projects. The selfless support he shows his friends may is as impressive as the initiative and drive he shows in his own work.  I am truly excited to see what Isaac achieves in the future!\n",

    "Thank you for caring Isaac, Kaggle was on mind but I'll consider about a personal project too. Kaggle looks tempting because it pushes you to catch the deadline and  getting help from the community etc.  I already have blog with only two posts and my fastbook course notes  (a fastpages blog) but I think I need to post regularly. In addition I also read @radek 's book Meta Learning thanks to @jeremyhoward 's lesson 0 (I believe) for the course. It is also inspiring.\n",

I was even thinking Making a website so people could upload a notebook and get Anki flashcard back. For now I need to go through live coding and data science book(wanted use flashcard for that book) that Jeremy mentioned. When/if I try to improve or make a UI for your notebook I will definitely get it touch with you since you did all the hard part.\n",
