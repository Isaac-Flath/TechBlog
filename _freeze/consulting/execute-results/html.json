This page outlines a few details that you'll need to know.  Before you read further, please realize:\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n\nThis is for decision makers looking to work with me directly.  **I am not interested in working with third party firms**.  I am happy with where I am at and what I do and don't need/want help finding additional work.\n\n:::\n\n# Why me?\n\nI have three core competencies and passions that combine to make me very valuable.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Technical\n\nA good technical consultant has significant technical skills.  I have expertise in a large range of technical topics including:\n\n+ Fundamentals\n    + A/B testing\n    + Metric design and how measures relate to behavior\n    + Experimentation mindset and design\n+ Fundamental modeling\n    + Life Time Value\n    + Multi-armed bandits\n    + Decision Tree processes\n+ AI Modeling\n    + Deep Learning (computer vision & NLP)\n    + Tabular data (random forest, XGboost, linear/logistic regression, etc.)\n    + Clustering (K-Means, Meanshift, Hierarchical, etc.)\n+ Communication & Logistics\n    + Model and application design and deployment\n    + Cloud Infrastructure\n    + Documentation\n:::\n    \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Teaching\n\n**A good consultant is a teacher**.  This is important because:\n\n+ Buying a solution is not enough to know how to use it proficiently.  **A good consultant teaches you so you are not dependent on them forever.**\n\n+ Businesses are made up of people.  **A good consultant enriches people as they work.**   The more skills your people have the faster you can move.  Employees that are learning and developing will be more engaged and motivated\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Business\nI have worked as a business process engineer.  I have worked in product management.  I have been a product owner.  I have managed many projects as head of data science.\n\nI understand how to **identify, prioritize, and manage what's important**.  More importantly I know how to **design processes to maintain the important things.**  When you move on to a new project or priority it's critical that you can still **maintain the value created by previous projects.**\n:::\n\n\n# How to Hire\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n### How to hire me\n\n+ **Reach out to me** with a short simple description of what you are trying to accomplish and how.  It doesn't need to be formal and if you don't know something that's ok!  I love working with people who admit when they don't know something!\n+ **Give me relevant links I can research** so I can learn more about your problem, industry, or related problems.  Before we talk I want to have done some research so I am not wasting your time or mine discussing things that could have been a google search.\n+ **My freelance rate is $250 per hour.**  I may be willing to work with you on price.  Here are things that make me willing to negotiate on price:\n    + Are you doing work for the good of others (ie nonprofits, charities, other)?\n    + Are you a minority or female owned small business?\n    + Are you doing something novel, interesting, or exciting (in my opinion)?\n    + When you communicated with me, was it clear and concise? Do you have a clear vision for what you want?  Unclear communication and unclear vision leads to extra back-and-forth and extra risk.  As with any business I expect to be compensated for additional risk.\n    + How busy am I?  Or to make it sound more professional, how much demand is there in the market for my services? \n:::\n\n",
