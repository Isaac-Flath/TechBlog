# About Me 👋

I'm a data scientist with a varied background who likes doing varied things.  It's also given me a wide range of skills that prove useful in all sorts of surprising ways.   

My most important ability is understanding strategic goals and being able to translate that into all the detailed steps needed to get there (and seeing what steps are not needed).  I developed this skill by getting experience in very different roles in lots of different parts of the business.

My primary hobby is dance.  I used to teach ballroom dance but now I mostly dance West Coast Swing.

# My professional journey in stages 🚀

**Moving up**: business process engineering ➢ product management

**Starting Technical Journey**: data analyst ➢ dynamics CRM developer

**Trying New Things**: accounting ➢ call center ➢ full-time ballroom dance teacher

**Finding my home ❤️**: product owner ➢ machine learning researcher ➢ data science

# 👨‍💻 How to get into data science 👩🏻‍💻

I recommend working through the [fastai courses](https://course.fast.ai/).  These are fantastic courses that teach great content, but also in an approachable way that enable you to use what your learn on real problems right away!

**Tinker with everything.**  Try to never ask "Would it work if I did X?" or "Can I accomplish X by doing Y?".  Instead, try it and see if it works.  It's worth the time investment.

**Do projects**  Do projects in parallel with courses, and after courses.  Don't wait.  Build stuff.  Doing projects should be where you put most of your time. 

**Teach to learn**  Teaching is a great way to learn, and if you have a record of it you build a portfolio at the same time!  I am a fan of doing this via blogging [for many reasons](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045).  See [my FAQ](other/bloggingFAQ.qmd) for some help getting started!

**Keep at it** and be tenacious.  There is discomfort with learning any skill. You'll be frustrated at times.  That's a sign that there's a concept worth learning and once you do figure it out you'll have made a big step forward.
