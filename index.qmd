# About Me üëã

I'm a data scientist with a varied background who likes solving a variety of problems for clients.  My varied background has given me a wide range of skills that prove useful in all sorts of surprising ways.  I'm a big fan of learning new things.  Check out [my consulting page](isaacflath.website) for more information about what I can do for you.

My primary hobby is dance.  I used to teach ballroom dance, which is where I met my partner, but now I mostly dance West Coast Swing.  My partner now runs her own [dance instruction business](https://artofmovementdc.com/) here in D.C.

# üë®‚Äçüíª How to get into data science üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

I recommend working through the [fastai courses](https://course.fast.ai/).  These are fantastic courses that teach great content, but also in an approachable way that enable you to use what your learn on real problems right away!

**Tinker with everything.**  Try to never ask "Would it work if I did X?" or "Can I accomplish X by doing Y?".  Instead, try it and see if it works.  It's worth the time investment.

**Do projects**  Do projects in parallel with courses, and after courses.  Don't wait.  Build stuff.  Doing projects should be where you put most of your time. 

**Teach to learn**  Teaching is a great way to learn, and if you have a record of it you build a portfolio at the same time!  I am a fan of doing this via blogging [for many reasons](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045).  See [my FAQ](other/bloggingFAQ.qmd) for some help getting started!

**Keep at it** and be tenacious.  There is discomfort with learning any skill. You'll be frustrated at times.  That's a sign that there's a concept worth learning and once you do figure it out you'll have made a big step forward.
